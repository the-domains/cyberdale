  Life is a learning process. No one has the ability to know everything or even
  know how to do things without a reference point. Knowledge leads to
  understanding. Understanding leads to wisdom. When one is born, they have
  nothing. When they are old, they are filled with experience. Knowledge and
  understanding bring one away from the initial innocence of life, but is
  regained when one is born again into Christ.
